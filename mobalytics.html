                            I participated in a Mobalytics Externship, learning how to observe, gather, and analyze trends in the video game industry in order to
                            create a pitch. The pitch centered around what new video game genres, target audiences, and features should Mobalytics look to target/implement in order to achieve further success.

                                Mobalytics is a Web3 gaming company that specializes in their software program that allows it to analyze and present players real time data and summaries of their

                                Based on the list of highest grossing mobile gacha games, I picked 2 games to research: Limbus Company and Arknights. I also chose the popular desktop game, Osu!, knwon for itself
                                competitive community. In Excel, I did Ethnographic-esque research on the online community surrounding these games and researched specifics such as revenue in the past year. With this 
                                information, I used it to build and present my pitch.

                                My pitch was for the company to focus on the mobile gaming community, due to its increase/projected in revenue, and the community growth due to the ease and accessibility of mobile games. 
                                I pitched that Arknights has the potential for new customers due to the large focus on performances, while Limbus Company and Osu! may not be worth the investment as the former lacks a competitive community and
                                the latter already has built in performance tracking features. At the end of my externship, I recieved an "Outstansing Completion" due to recieving high ratings on my tasks and pitch.
